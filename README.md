# Minesweeper Mini

## (Group 9 project - Phase 2 of SDF-FT14)

## Overview; About the Project.

MiniSweeper is a simplified version of the classic Minesweeper game. The goal is to create a functional and engaging game that can be played in a web browser.

### MVP Features:

1. **Game Board**: A grid-based game board with randomly placed mines.
2. **Gameplay**: Players can click on cells to reveal their contents. If a cell contains a mine, the game is over. If a cell is empty, it will reveal the number of adjacent mines.
3. **Win Condition**: The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.
4. **Reset Button**: A button to reset the game and start a new round.

### User Interface

- The game board will be displayed as a grid of cells.
- Each cell will have a distinct visual representation (e.g., empty cells will be blank, mine cells will have a mine icon, and numbered cells will display the number of adjacent mines).
- The reset button will be prominently displayed above or below the game board.

### Technical Requirements

- The game will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The game board will be generated dynamically using JavaScript.
- The game will use a simple random number generator to place mines on the board.


### Future Development

- Add additional features, such as:
    - Timer and score tracking.
    - Different difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
    - Customizable game board size.
    - Animations and sound effects.
